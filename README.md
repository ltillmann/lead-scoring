# Lead Scoring Case Study

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a lead scoring model for an online education company, X Education, which offers courses to industry professionals. The company generates leads through various channels, including online marketing and referrals, but faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate of around 30%.

## Problem Statement
X Education wants to improve its lead conversion rate by identifying the most promising leads, or "Hot Leads". The goal is to build a predictive model that assigns a lead score to each prospect, helping the sales team prioritize their efforts on high-potential leads. The target lead conversion rate is set at 80%.

## Dataset
The dataset provided consists of around 9000 leads with various attributes like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable is 'Converted', indicating whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0).

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handle null values and irrelevant categories in categorical variables.
- **Model Building:** Develop a logistic regression model to predict lead scores.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance in assigning scores that correlate with higher conversion chances.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset and clean the data by handling null values and irrelevant categories.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Select relevant features that influence lead conversion.
3. **Model Training:** Build and train a logistic regression model.
4. **Scoring and Validation:** Assign lead scores and validate the model's accuracy in predicting conversions.


## Inspiration
The primary goal is to assist the sales team in improving efficiency by focusing on high-potential leads, ultimately increasing the lead conversion rate.
